# NotEngine_Wii
A little framework that can render sound and 2d graphics on the PSP.

- Handle ym file format
- TRS Sprites (maybe I've implemented a bit of animation)
- Bitmap font

Sadly I have not touched these source since a long time, so I decide to put them here for the lulz.

It has some dependencies:
- StSoundLib (http://leonard.oxg.free.fr/)
