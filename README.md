# NotEngine_Wii
A little framework that can render sound and 2d graphics on the PSP.

- Handle ym file format
- TRS Sprites (maybe I've implemented a bit of animation)
- Bitmap font

Sadly I have not touched these source since a long time, so I decide to put them here for the lulz. All the graphics part is mostly written by me, I've spent a long time to learn how it work and this set of source is FAR to be complete with the GPU and GX capabilities, but it should render sprites efficiently (I hope :)). I would love to try the TileMap functions of the GX API (they are handled manually in the code), and the TEV because it is an interresting things too.

It has some dependencies:
- StSoundLib (http://leonard.oxg.free.fr/)
